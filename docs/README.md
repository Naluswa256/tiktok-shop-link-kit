## üöÄ Quick Start

### For Developers
1. **Setup**: Follow the [Local Development Guide](./development/local-development.md)
2. **Architecture**: Understand the [System Architecture](./architecture/system-architecture.md)
3. **Workflows**: Learn about [GitHub Workflows](./workflows/github-workflows.md)

### For DevOps Engineers
1. **Infrastructure**: Review [AWS Production Deployment](./deployment/aws-production.md)
2. **Operations**: Study [Operational Runbooks](./operations/runbooks.md)
3. **Comparison**: Understand [Environment Differences](./deployment/environment-comparison.md)

### For Product Managers

2. **Capabilities**: Review service capabilities in each architecture document
3. **Scaling**: Understand [Scalability Considerations](./architecture/system-architecture.md#scalability--performance)

## üéØ Key Concepts

### Event-Driven Architecture
The system uses an event-driven microservice architecture where:
- Services communicate via SNS/SQS messaging
- AI workers process content asynchronously
- Frontend receives real-time updates via WebSockets

### Microservices Pattern
Each service has a specific responsibility:
- **Ingestion API**: TikTok link processing
- **Product Service**: Product catalog management
- **WhatsApp Service**: WhatsApp Business integration
- **AI Workers**: Content analysis and processing

### Cloud-Native Design
Built for AWS with:
- Auto-scaling ECS services
- Serverless Lambda functions
- Managed databases (DynamoDB)
- CDN and edge optimization (CloudFront)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for development and building
- **Tailwind CSS** + **shadcn/ui** for styling
- **React Query** for data fetching

### Backend
- **NestJS** microservices with TypeScript
- **AWS Lambda** for AI workers (Python)
- **DynamoDB** for data storage
- **Redis** for caching

### Infrastructure
- **AWS** cloud services
- **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code
- **Docker** for containerization
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD

## üìä System Metrics

### Performance Targets
- **API Response Time**: < 200ms (95th percentile)
- **AI Processing Time**: < 30 seconds per video
- **Availability**: 99.99% uptime
- **Scalability**: Auto-scale from 2 to 20 instances

### Cost Estimates
- **Development**: ~$0/month (LocalStack + free tiers)
- **Staging**: ~$100/month
- **Production**: ~$300-500/month (depending on usage)

## üîí Security

### Security Measures
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with role-based access
- **Encryption**: TLS in transit, AES-256 at rest
- **Network**: VPC with security groups and NACLs
- **Secrets**: AWS Secrets Manager for API keys
- **Monitoring**: CloudTrail for audit logging

### Compliance
- **Data Protection**: GDPR-compliant data handling
- **API Security**: Rate limiting and WAF protection
- **Access Control**: Least privilege IAM policies

## üìà Monitoring & Observability

### Monitoring Stack
- **Logs**: CloudWatch Logs with structured logging
- **Metrics**: CloudWatch metrics and custom dashboards
- **Tracing**: AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing
- **Alerts**: CloudWatch alarms with SNS notifications

### Key Metrics
- **Application**: Response times, error rates, throughput
- **Infrastructure**: CPU, memory, disk, network utilization
- **Business**: Processing volumes, user engagement, conversion rates

## ü§ù Contributing
