# AWS Cognito Client Secret Configuration

## Overview

AWS Cognito supports two types of app clients:
1. **Public clients** - No client secret (for mobile apps, SPAs)
2. **Confidential clients** - With client secret (for server-side applications)

When your Cognito app client has a client secret configured, you **MUST** include a `SECRET_HASH` parameter in all authentication API calls. This is a security requirement enforced by AWS Cognito.

## When is SECRET_HASH Required?

The `SECRET_HASH` parameter is required for these Cognito API operations when your app client has a client secret:

### Authentication Parameters (in `AuthParameters`)
- `InitiateAuth`
- `AdminInitiateAuth`

### Challenge Responses (in `ChallengeResponses`)
- `RespondToAuthChallenge`
- `AdminRespondToAuthChallenge`

### Direct Parameters
- `SignUp` (as `SecretHash`)
- `ConfirmSignUp` (as `SecretHash`)
- `ForgotPassword` (as `SecretHash`)
- `ConfirmForgotPassword` (as `SecretHash`)
- `ResendConfirmationCode` (as `SecretHash`)

## SECRET_HASH Calculation

The SECRET_HASH is calculated using this formula:
```
Base64(HMAC_SHA256("Client Secret Key", "Username" + "Client Id"))
```

### Implementation in Our Service

Our `AuthService` automatically calculates and includes the SECRET_HASH when needed:

```typescript
private calculateSecretHash(username: string): string | undefined {
  if (!this.clientSecret) {
    return undefined; // No secret hash needed for public clients
  }

  const message = username + this.clientId;
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', this.clientSecret);
  hmac.update(message);
  return hmac.digest('base64');
}
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Add the client secret to your environment configuration:

```bash
# Required for all clients
COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=us-east-1_XXXXXXXXX
COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=your-cognito-client-id

# Required only if your app client has a secret configured
COGNITO_CLIENT_SECRET=your-cognito-client-secret
```

### Getting Your Client Secret

1. Go to AWS Cognito Console
2. Select your User Pool
3. Go to "App integration" â†’ "App clients"
4. Select your app client
5. Click "Show Details" to reveal the client secret

## Error Messages

If you have a client secret configured but don't include SECRET_HASH, you'll get:
```
Unable to verify secret hash for client <client-id>
```

## Best Practices

### For Server-Side Applications (Recommended)
- Use confidential clients with client secrets
- Store client secret securely (environment variables, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Never expose client secret in client-side code

### For Client-Side Applications
- Use public clients without client secrets
- Suitable for mobile apps, SPAs where secrets cannot be kept secure

## Migration Guide

If you're migrating from a public client to a confidential client:

1. **Update Cognito App Client**:
   - Generate a client secret in AWS Console
   - Note down the secret securely

2. **Update Environment Configuration**:
   ```bash
   COGNITO_CLIENT_SECRET=your-new-client-secret
   ```

3. **Deploy Updated Service**:
   - Our service automatically detects the presence of client secret
   - SECRET_HASH will be calculated and included automatically

4. **Test Authentication**:
   - Verify signup, signin, and token refresh work correctly
   - Check logs for any "Unable to verify secret hash" errors

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Unable to verify secret hash for client"**
   - Ensure `COGNITO_CLIENT_SECRET` is set correctly
   - Verify the secret matches what's configured in AWS Console
   - Check that SECRET_HASH is being calculated with correct username

2. **Authentication works without SECRET_HASH**
   - Your app client is configured as public (no secret)
   - This is fine for client-side applications

3. **SECRET_HASH mismatch**
   - Verify username format (should match what you use for signup)
   - Ensure client ID and secret are correct
   - Check for any encoding issues

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging to see SECRET_HASH calculation:

```bash
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

This will log (without exposing secrets):
- Whether client secret is configured
- Whether SECRET_HASH is being calculated
- Authentication flow details

## Security Considerations

1. **Never log the actual client secret or SECRET_HASH values**
2. **Store client secret in secure environment variables**
3. **Use AWS Secrets Manager for production environments**
4. **Rotate client secrets periodically**
5. **Monitor for authentication failures that might indicate secret compromise**
